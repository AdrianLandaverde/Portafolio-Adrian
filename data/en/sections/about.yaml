In addition to my competition successes, I had the honor of serving as the President of the [Student Society of Engineering in Data Science and Maths (SAIDM)](https://instagram.com/saidm.cem?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) at Tec de Monterrey Campus Estado de MÃ©xico. Through this role, I organized courses that deepened the understanding of Data Science among fellow students.


My commitment to continuous learning is evident in the completion of over [100 data science courses](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFsSNhdbII/6syGMvE15r-nDjwwtazBMg/view?utm_content=DAFsSNhdbII&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink). This extensive coursework has not only propelled my personal growth in the field but has also facilitated my study abroad experience at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), a globally recognized institution ranked among the top 100 universities in the world according to the QS World Ranking.
