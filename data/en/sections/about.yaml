I was president of the [SAIDM](https://instagram.com/saidm.cem?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) (Student Society of Engineering in Data Science and Maths at Tec de Monterrey Campus Estado de MÃ©xico, in which we organize courses related to Data Science.


I've also taken more than a [100 data science courses](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFsSNhdbII/6syGMvE15r-nDjwwtazBMg/view?utm_content=DAFsSNhdbII&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink), which had led me to advance in this field on my own and getting lots of knowledge. This also gave me the opportunity to study abroad at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), which is in the top 100 Univeristies in the world according to the QS World Ranking."
